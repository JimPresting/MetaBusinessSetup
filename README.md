# Setting Up a Meta Business Account/Portfolio from Scratch  
**Note:** You must have a registered business to follow these steps and verify your account.


1. Go to business.facebook.com and create a business portfolio (if its your first you should be prompted with it directly)

2. Now, go to the **Business Portfolio Info** section and fill out the required details by clicking **Edit** under **Business Details**.

3. After that, select the newly created **Business Portfolio** and navigate to **Business Manager Settings**.

4. Now, if you click on **Security Center** to verify your business, it will most likely display the message: **"Your organization does not need to be verified."**

Thatâ€™s because you havenâ€™t created or added anything that would prompt Meta to require verification.  

ðŸ‘‰ **Quick workaround:** Simply create an app.

Fill out the parameters however you likeâ€”you can always delete it later.

It will redirect you to the [developers.facebook.com](https://developers.facebook.com) page. You can close that tab for now and return to the Business Manager site. Then, click on **Security Center** again. It should now prompt you with a button to **Start your verification**. Click on "Start Verification".

Enter your information, and if your company can't be found, you can select **"My business isn't listed."** However, I'm not sure how the setup process changes from that point onward.![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/05f984c8-6c7b-4ccd-900a-bc2cbbd04115)

It then requires you to attach a document which approves your connection to the business

it will prompt you with "We'll use the official government-issued ID or official document you provide to help confirm your relationship to the business."

After submitting your ID, they will notify you that it takes approximately 48 hours for them to review it.
